### What I learned

I focused more on the architecture of the code in this project. 
At the first attempt i realized, iÂ´ve managed myself into a dead end and started from zero.
I watched a very helpfull video from freecodecamp at youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoQ6S1a32j8) 
and wanted to implement some of the workflow into my projects.
