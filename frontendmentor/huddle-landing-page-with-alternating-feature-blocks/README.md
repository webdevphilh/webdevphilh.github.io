## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS


### What I learned

- the work on the white logo svg in the footer.
  I could have just make a second one and make it white but i wanted to know how to do it with css alone.
- this is the second "mobile first" approach for me. And the first where i felt that i kinda got a hang on it. 

### Continued development

In this project i should have done more planing before coding. Some subclasses for styling and overall software architecture beforehand.
This is something I will definetly work on in my next frontendmentor project.
